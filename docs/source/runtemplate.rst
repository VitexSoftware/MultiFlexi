The `RunTemplate` is a key component of the MultiFlexi application. It allows users to define environment and frequency for running an application.

Actions Configuration
--------------------

RunTemplates can be configured with actions that execute when specific events occur during job execution. Actions provide integration with external systems and services.

**Available Action Types**:

- **Success Actions**: Execute when jobs complete successfully
- **Fail Actions**: Execute when jobs fail or encounter errors

**Configuring Actions**:

1. Navigate to your RunTemplate in the web interface
2. Click "Configure Actions"  
3. Select the desired action type (e.g., ToDo, Email, etc.)
4. Configure the action parameters and credentials
5. Save the configuration

For detailed information about available actions and their configuration, see the :doc:`actions` section.
