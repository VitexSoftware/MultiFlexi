## 🔧 Technical Features

### Three Deletion Strategies

1. **Soft Deletion** (Immediate Processing)
   - Account disabled and marked as deleted
   - Data preserved for legal compliance
   - Can be processed without admin approval

2. **Hard Deletion** (Admin Approval Required)
   - Permanent removal of personal data
   - Respects legal retention requirements
   - Dependency checking to prevent business disruption
   - Shared data protection

3. **Anonymization** (Admin Approval Required)
   - Personal data replaced with anonymous values
   - Data structure preserved for analytics
   - Account disabled but relationships maintained

### Data Protection Measures

- **Shared Company Data Protection**: Prevents deletion of companies/templates used by other users
- **Dependency Checking**: Validates data relationships before deletion
- **Legal Retention Compliance**: 
  - Audit logs: 7 years (2555 days)
  - Financial records: 10 years (3650 days)
  - Job logs: 1 year (365 days)
  - Personal data: Can be deleted immediately

### Comprehensive Audit Trail

- Every deletion operation logged with:
  - Timestamp and performing user
  - Table and record affected
  - Action taken (deleted/anonymized/retained)
  - Reason for action
  - Before/after data snapshots
- Audit trail integrity verification
- CSV export functionality
- 7-year retention with automated cleanup

## 🖥️ User Interfaces
